# StreamingSearch

## Description

The overall purpose of this project was to learn how to collaborate as a group of developers to create a working product -- in this case, a website -- using javascript, a web framework, JQuery, third party APIs, and the Git workflow. With so many streaming services available today, our group chose to build a website that allows you to search the various streaming services for movies and television shows.
